# OClaI

An offline agentic CLI that brings Claude Code and Gemini CLI capabilities to your terminal using local AI models.

## TODO

- [ ] Fix CLI messages and prompts to ensure they are clear and user-friendly.
- [ ] Structure the codebase by organizing each command into its own package for better maintainability.
- [ ] Integrate the MCP Client and set default MCP servers to enhance functionality.
- [ ] Update the configuration system to allow users to add their own MCP servers.
- [ ] Implement lazy-loading for MCP servers to optimize performance. Instead of initializing all servers at once, load them on demand.
- [ ] Implement a 2-agent workflow, where the primary agent acts as the master and the secondary agent functions as a slave.
- [ ] Improve the interface to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.
- [ ] Use goreleaser library and automate the release process using GitHub actions.
